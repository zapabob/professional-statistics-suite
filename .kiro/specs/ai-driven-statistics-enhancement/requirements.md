# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of the existing Professional Statistics Suite to become a more comprehensive AI-driven statistical software platform. The enhancement focuses on improving the AI integration capabilities, expanding statistical analysis features, and creating a more intuitive user experience for both novice and expert statisticians. The system will leverage multiple LLM providers, implement advanced RAG capabilities, and provide intelligent statistical guidance while maintaining commercial-grade security and licensing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want an intelligent statistical assistant that can understand my analysis goals in natural language and automatically suggest appropriate statistical methods, so that I can perform complex analyses without deep statistical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user inputs a natural language query about their data analysis goal THEN the system SHALL analyze the query and suggest 3-5 appropriate statistical methods with explanations
2. WHEN the system suggests statistical methods THEN it SHALL provide confidence scores and rationale for each suggestion based on data characteristics
3. IF the user's query is ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask clarifying questions to better understand the analysis requirements
4. WHEN statistical methods are suggested THEN the system SHALL explain assumptions, limitations, and prerequisites for each method in user-friendly language

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the AI system to automatically validate my statistical approach and warn me about potential issues, so that I can ensure the reliability and validity of my analysis results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a statistical method THEN the system SHALL automatically check if the data meets the method's assumptions
2. IF statistical assumptions are violated THEN the system SHALL provide specific warnings and suggest alternative approaches or data transformations
3. WHEN the system detects potential issues THEN it SHALL explain the implications in plain language and provide actionable recommendations
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide an automated quality assessment report highlighting strengths and limitations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want the system to generate comprehensive, publication-ready reports with visualizations and interpretations, so that I can quickly communicate findings to stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN statistical analysis is completed THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a structured report with executive summary, methodology, results, and conclusions
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create appropriate visualizations based on data type and analysis method
3. WHEN creating visualizations THEN the system SHALL follow best practices for data visualization and include proper labels, legends, and captions
4. IF the user requests specific report formats THEN the system SHALL support multiple output formats including PDF, HTML, and PowerPoint

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a statistics student, I want the system to provide educational explanations and step-by-step guidance, so that I can learn statistical concepts while performing analyses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any statistical operation THEN the system SHALL provide optional educational explanations of the underlying concepts
2. WHEN explanations are requested THEN the system SHALL adapt the complexity level based on user's indicated expertise level
3. WHEN showing statistical results THEN the system SHALL explain what the numbers mean in practical terms
4. IF a user makes a methodological error THEN the system SHALL provide constructive feedback and learning opportunities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want advanced AI capabilities including code generation, automated feature engineering, and predictive modeling suggestions, so that I can accelerate my workflow and explore new analytical approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes an analysis goal THEN the system SHALL generate executable Python code with proper error handling and documentation
2. WHEN working with datasets THEN the system SHALL suggest relevant feature engineering techniques based on data characteristics
3. WHEN appropriate THEN the system SHALL recommend machine learning approaches and automatically tune hyperparameters
4. WHEN code is generated THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive comments explaining each step and decision

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust multi-LLM provider support with failover capabilities and cost optimization, so that the system remains reliable and cost-effective across different usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an LLM provider fails THEN the system SHALL automatically failover to alternative providers without user intervention
2. WHEN multiple providers are available THEN the system SHALL route requests based on cost, performance, and capability requirements
3. WHEN using cloud-based LLMs THEN the system SHALL track and optimize token usage to minimize costs
4. WHEN local LLM options are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize them for sensitive data processing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit trails and data privacy controls, so that the system meets regulatory requirements for sensitive data analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL log all operations with timestamps, user identification, and data fingerprints
2. WHEN sensitive data is detected THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate privacy controls and use local processing when possible
3. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive logs showing all data access and analysis activities
4. IF data export is attempted THEN the system SHALL enforce appropriate authorization and logging requirements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a power user, I want advanced customization options including custom statistical methods, personalized AI prompts, and workflow automation, so that I can tailor the system to my specific analytical needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user wants to add custom methods THEN the system SHALL provide interfaces for registering custom statistical functions with proper validation
2. WHEN users have specific prompt preferences THEN the system SHALL allow customization of AI interaction patterns and response styles
3. WHEN repetitive workflows are identified THEN the system SHALL offer automation options and template creation
4. WHEN custom configurations are created THEN the system SHALL support sharing and version control of user customizations
